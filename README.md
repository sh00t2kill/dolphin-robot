## Troubleshooting

Before opening an issue, please provide logs related to the issue,
For debug log level, please add the following to your config.yaml

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.mydolphin_plus: debug
```

Please attach also diagnostic details of the integration, available in:
Settings -> Devices & Services -> MyDolphin Plus -> 3 dots menu -> Download diagnostics

### Invalid Token

In case you have referenced to that section, something went wrong with the encryption key,
Encryption key should be located in `.storage/mydolphin_plus.config.json` file under `data.key` property,
below are the steps to solve that issue.

#### File not exists or File exists, data.key is not

Please report as issue

#### File exists, data.key is available

Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "minor_version": 1,
  "key": "mydolphin_plus.config.json",
  "data": {
    "key": "ox-qQsAiHb67Kz3ypxY19uU2_YwVcSjvdbaBVHZJQFY=",
    "b8fa11c50331d2647b8aa7e37935efeb": {
      "locating": false,
      "aws-token-encrypted-key": "AWS_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

OR

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "minor_version": 1,
  "key": "mydolphin_plus.config.json",
  "data": {
    "key": "ox-qQsAiHb67Kz3ypxY19uU2_YwVcSjvdbaBVHZJQFY="
  }
}
```

1. Remove the integration
2. Delete the file
3. Restart HA
4. Try to re-add the integration
5. If still happens - report as issue

#### File exists, key is available under one of the entry configurations

Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "minor_version": 1,
  "key": "mydolphin_plus.config.json",
  "data": {
    "b8fa11c50331d2647b8aa7e37935efeb": {
      "key": "ox-qQsAiHb67Kz3ypxY19uU2_YwVcSjvdbaBVHZJQFY=",
      "locating": false,
      "aws-token-encrypted-key": "AWS_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

1. Move the `key` to the root of the JSON
2. Restart HA
3. Try to re-add the integration
4. If still happens - follow instructions of section #1 (_i._)

## Lovelace cards.

We have confirmed the robot works with the custom vacuum card, built by denysdovhan
https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card

Copy the icons from www on the repository to /config/www. Below is a suggested configuration for the card

```yaml
type: tile
entity: vacuum.robot_name
show_entity_picture: true
features:
  - type: vacuum-commands
    commands:
      - start_pause
      - stop
      - locate
      - return_home
```
