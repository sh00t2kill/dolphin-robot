[Changelog](https://github.com/sh00t2kill/dolphin-robot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Status: WIP

Integration is still work in progress, not tested with HA with all its functionality,
to test you can run the CLI mode or within the HA.

### TODO
- ~~On startup trigger the get topic from MQTT as happens when the mobile app is being opened~~
- Implement publish commands to the robot (currently stubs that logs the action only)
- ~~Map the select values to the real one from the app (currently available assumed values)~~
- ~~Align consts to the real values of select~~
- ~~Map remote commands~~
- ~~Create services~~
- Test ~~, test and more test~~ actions
