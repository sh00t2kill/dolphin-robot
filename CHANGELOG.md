| DEBUG                | Boolean | False   | Setting to True will present DEBUG log level message while testing the code, False will set the minimum log level to INFO |

TODO:

- Create sensors and binary sensors based on data retrieved from the MyDolphin Plus app and cloud
- Test the solution within HA
- Add custom component to HACS
- Update [README.md](README.md) (currently available in [info.md](info.md))
